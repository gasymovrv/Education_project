/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/
 * <p>
 * Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together.
 * You can return the answer in any order.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
 * Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
 * The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
 * The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: strs = [""]
 * Output: [[""]]
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * Input: strs = ["a"]
 * Output: [["a"]]
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
 * 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
 * strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
